### **Introduction**
This project demonstrates the functionality of an RRR robotic arm, simulating its movement through a predefined geometric trajectory for 3D printing applications. The project highlights:
- **Trajectory generation**
- **Inverse kinematics calculations**
- **3D visualization of the robot and its workspace**

---

### **Features**
- Trajectory generation for complex geometric shapes
- Accurate inverse kinematics for position control
- Dynamic visualization of the robotic arm and its end-effector path
- Fully parameterized for easy modifications

---

### **Requirements**
- **MATLAB R2020a** or later
- Toolboxes: 
  - **Robotics System Toolbox** (recommended but not mandatory)
  - **MATLAB Graphics Toolbox**
- Basic understanding of MATLAB scripting and robotic kinematics.
